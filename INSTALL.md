# Installation for development of **flatlakeTools**

**flatlakeTools** This is an experimental proof of concept set of tools for
working with the FlatLake API generated by CloudCannon&#x27;s Flat. The goal is
to easily generate RSS 2.0 feeds from the JSON API as well as generated index
blog page(s).

## Quick install with curl or irm

There is an experimental installer.sh script that can be run with the following
command to install latest table release. This may work for macOS, Linux and if
youâ€™re using Windows with the Unix subsystem. This would be run from your shell
(e.g. Terminal on macOS).

```shell
curl https://caltechlibrary.github.io/flatlakeTools/installer.sh | sh
```

This will install the programs included in flatlakeTools in your `$HOME/bin`
directory.

If you are running Windows 10 or 11 use the Powershell command below.

```ps1
irm https://caltechlibrary.github.io/flatlakeTools/installer.ps1 | iex
```

### If your are running macOS or Windows

You may get security warnings if you are using macOS or Windows. See the notes
for the specific operating system you're using to fix issues.
