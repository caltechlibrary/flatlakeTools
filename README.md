# flatlakeTools

This is an experimental proof of concept set of tools for working with the
FlatLake API generated by CloudCannon's Flat. The goal is to easily generate RSS
2.0 feeds from the JSON API as well as generated index blog page(s).

The primary tool is called `flt`. It is a command line tool supporting a YAML
configuration file and actions for processing the JSON API provided by
[FlatLake](https://flatlake.app) application. The configuration is combined with
an action and data source path to produce the desired content via standard out.

Here's the basic form of the command.

```
flt CHANNEL_NAME OUTPUT_FORMAT
```

Here's an example of rendering a RSS 2.0 `index.xml` file.

```shell
flt index rss api/all/page-1.json >index.xml
```

Here's an example of rendering a CommonMark index file suitable for a blog.

```shell
flt index markdown api/all/page-1.json >index.md
```

The `flt.yaml` file might look something like this.

```yaml
channels:
  - name: index
    title: "Tech Insights Blog"
    description: "The latest insights and news from the world of technology."
    link: "https://example.com/tech-insights"
    language: "en-us"
    copyright: "Copyright 2023 Tech Insights Blog. All rights reserved."
    managingEditor: "editor@techinsights.com"
    webMaster: "webmaster@techinsights.com"
```
